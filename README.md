- Create Teams to see your entire raid team's current loot progression status.
- Access Loot Tracking systems that automatically update your Team Member's BIS information when they recieve items.
- Also access a (beta) Solver for optimising loot handouts in the fairest way to get you finished with a fight ASAP.
- And if your friends don't want to join the site, make proxies for all their characters to still get all of these features!

## Development
TODO - Will write this section once I set up my new laptop and figure out the hoops I have to jump through :D
I expect to provide a small test DB with information on how to login to the test account for ease of development.
